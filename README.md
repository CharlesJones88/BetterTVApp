# Better TV App
This application was created by Charles Jones & Allison Turnblom.
The app was built to display Movies and TV shows from various providers, displayed by category with a few filters and sorting options. The project implements [Angular](angular), [Material 2](material-two), [Express](express), and [Node](node) and uses the [Guidebox](guidebox) and [OMDB](omdb) APIs to fetch movie metadata.

### Setting up the app
1. The [angular-cli] must be installed.
2. In the tv-app directory run ```npm install``` then ```ng build```.
3. In the parent directory to start the application run ```npm install``` and then ```npm start```, the server will tell what ```IP``` and ```PORT``` it is listening on to navigate to in the browser.
